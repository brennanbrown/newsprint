We have optimized every aspect of information consumption for speed. It's time to ask whether we've optimized away the point entirely.

There is a particular kind of anxiety that comes from watching your "read later" list grow faster than you can possibly consume it. The articles pile up — important, interesting, urgent — and the weight of all that unread knowledge becomes its own burden.

But what if the problem isn't that we read too slowly? What if it's that we've confused consumption with comprehension?

## The Speed Trap

The average person now encounters more words in a single day than a 15th-century scholar would have encountered in a year. We've responded to this deluge by developing sophisticated skimming strategies. We read headlines, scan bullet points, and extract the gist before moving on to the next piece.

This works fine for commodity information. But it fails catastrophically for the kind of writing that actually changes how we think.

> "Reading, real reading, is not a passive act. It is the most vigorous form of thinking available to us."

## The Case for Going Slow

Slow reading doesn't mean reading inefficiently. It means reading with intention. It means choosing fewer pieces and giving them your full attention. It means sitting with an idea long enough to understand not just what the author said, but why they said it and whether you agree.

The irony is that slow reading is ultimately more efficient. A single deeply understood article provides more lasting value than twenty pieces skimmed and forgotten by next Tuesday.

## A Practical Suggestion

This week, try an experiment. Choose one long article — something that requires more than five minutes of attention. Read it without your phone nearby. Read it twice if something puzzles you. Take notes if you're so inclined.

You may find that the experience is not just intellectually richer but genuinely more pleasurable. The reading we remember, the reading that shapes us, has always been slow.
