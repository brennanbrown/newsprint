**WASHINGTON, Aug. 26.**—The women of America were today formally enfranchised. Secretary of State Colby at 8 o'clock this morning signed the proclamation which makes the suffrage amendment a part of the United States Constitution.

The signing took place at the Secretary's home without ceremony of any kind. None of the leaders of the woman's suffrage movement was present.

Colby signed the proclamation as soon as he arrived at his home from the State Department, where he had been working on the document until a late hour last night.

The proclamation was signed in the presence of several officials of the State Department.

The women of the country have been waiting for this moment for more than half a century. The 19th amendment was first introduced in Congress in 1878.

The ratification of the amendment was completed by the Tennessee legislature last week. The certificate of ratification from Tennessee reached Washington early this morning.

Suffrage leaders were somewhat disappointed when they learned that the proclamation had been signed without any public ceremony. They had hoped to be present when the document was signed.

However, they were quick to express their joy at the final victory.

"This is the greatest day in the history of American women," said one of the leaders. "We have won a long and hard fight, and we are now ready to take our place as full citizens of the United States."

The enfranchisement of women will add about 27,000,000 voters to the electorate of the country.
